# Artstation Database (University Project)

Welcome to the Artstation Database project! ðŸŽ¨

In this exciting venture, we set out to create a sleek and efficient database tailored specifically for the Artstation platform. Our journey took us through the entire development process, from ideation to implementation. We meticulously crafted an E-R conceptual database model, translating our ideas into a robust relational model using PostgreSQL.

## Project Highlights

- **Concept to Reality:** We initiated the project by brainstorming and conceptualizing the database structure. This laid the foundation for our journey from theory to practice.

- **E-R Conceptual Database Model:** Take a sneak peek into our thought process with the [Conceptual Scheme](DatabaseER.jpeg). This visual representation showcases the blueprint of our database design.

- **Logical Implementation:** Transitioning from theory to practice, we seamlessly brought our conceptual model to life with a logical implementation. PostgreSQL proved to be our trusty companion throughout this phase.

## Documentation

For an in-depth exploration of our project, dive into our [Documentation](Database-Documentation.pdf) (available in Italian). It covers everything from the initial stages of concept development to the nitty-gritty details of the final implementation.
