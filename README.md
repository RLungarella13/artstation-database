# Artstation Database (University Project)

Welcome to the Artstation Database project! ðŸŽ¨

In this project, we set out to create a sleek and efficient database tailored specifically for the Artstation platform. Our journey took us through the entire development process, from ideation to implementation. We meticulously crafted an E-R conceptual database model, translating our ideas into a robust relational model using PostgreSQL.

## Project Highlights

- **Concept to Reality:** We initiated the project by brainstorming and conceptualizing the database structure. This laid the foundation for our journey from theory to practice;

- **Logical Implementation:** Transitioning from theory to practice, we seamlessly brought our conceptual model to life with a logical implementation. PostgreSQL proved to be our trusty companion throughout this phase.

## What We Did

Our project centered around creating a database for a specific platform of our choice, and the journey was nothing short of exhilarating! Here's a breakdown of our key activities:

### 1. Client-Side Magic ðŸŽ©

We kicked things off by stepping into the clients' shoes. Crafting a comprehensive contract with specific requests and requirements paved the way for our database creation. Learning how to articulate project goals effectively became our initial victory, transcending beyond just database development.

### 2. Data Wizards at Work ðŸ§™

The data wizardry began with an in-depth analysis of specifications. Translating the project accurately was our goal during this phase. We embarked on a conceptual design journey with multiple revisions, applying various design patterns to shape the database.

### 3. Logical Wizardry ðŸ”®

Transitioning to the logical design, we conducted performance analysis, fine-tuned generalizations, considered partitions, and selected primary identifiers. This led us to the formulation of a logical schema. Normalizing the database using Boyce-Codd form followed, ensuring its optimal structure.

### 4. Trigger Implementation ðŸŽ¯

Triggering the next phase, we designed triggers and brought the actual database to life. The insertion process was facilitated by the invaluable assistance of ChatGPT, ensuring the seamless functioning of the entire database, with a keen focus on triggers.

### 5. Views and Queries Finale ðŸ“Š

Wrapping up the project, the final stretch was dedicated to creating views and queries, poised to enhance the Artstation platform's usability. Each query and view was meticulously crafted to ensure their utility and relevance.
