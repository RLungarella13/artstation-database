# Artstation Database (University Project)
In this project we developed a streamlined database specifically designed for the Artstation platform. We undertook the entire process, starting from conceptualizing the database to its actual implementation. Initially, we crafted an E-R conceptual database model and then proceeded to create a logical implementation using a relational model. The entire project was accomplished using PostgreSQL.
